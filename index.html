            <h1>What is sustainable development,  and why should we care about it?</h1>
            <p>Sustainable development is a type of development which considers the future and how actions taken today can affect people years later. 
            This means being careful of our resources by not wasting or destroying unnescesarally, and practicing stewardship of the things God has given to us.
             As Christians, we should protect God’s creation, and be mindful of how our actions impact the things and people around us. 
            </p>
            <p>An example of wastefulness is the coal mining industry, which has depleted the supply so much that soon it will run out. 
             Instead of overusing this resource, we can look to other means of producing power. 
             In this website I’m going to talk about these renewable methods and how we can use them to better our world.

       	<h1>Solar Power</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Solar Panels.jpg" alt="">
       	<p>
			According to energy.gov, The amount of sunlight that strikes the earth's surface in an hour and a half is enough to handle the entire world's energy consumption for a full year. 
			This is a tremendous amount of power that people are willing to capture. 
			Right now, most of the energy used to power the world comes from burning coal and oil. 
			However, these are not renewable resources. 
			Sunlight is a viable option to use instead of these because there are no major side effects such as CO2 emissions.
       	</p>
		<p>Solar panels are the most common form of collecting the sun’s energy. 
			They use photovoltaic cells which create electrical charges, allowing for the capture and use of electrical power. 
			Many homes and businesses use small arrays of these panels to offset the cost of electrical bills. </p>

       	<h1>Wind Power</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Wind Turbines.jpg" alt="">
       	<p>
			Wind power has been used for many years to aid us in tasks. 
			With modern technology, the power of the wind can be used to produce electricity for our lives. 
			Wind is caused by the sun’s uneven heating of the atmosphere, irregularities in the earth’s surface, and the rotation of our earth. 
			If you’ve ever sailed before, you’ve seen the power it can have. 
			This would be great as a renewable resource, but it only works when the wind is blowing. 
       	</p>
		<p>
			Throughout our world, the strength of wind varies greatly. 
			Building wind farms would only be worth it in places with high average wind speeds. 
			Engineers can build wind turbines on water or other places to provide power to cities around them.

       	<h1>Hydropower</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Hydropower Energy.jpg" alt="">
       	<p>
			Much like wind power, water power has been used for many years. 
			The technology has increased from watermills to massive dams, but the principles are the same. 
			Hydropower facilities work by running water through turbines, which provide power. 
			This is a great method of sustainable power, as the power output doesn’t fluctuate nearly as much as those dependent on wind or sunlight.
       	</p>
		<p>	However, some people believe it is not a great way to provide sustainable power. 
			Although it does not produce toxic waste or release greenhouse gases, it affects fish populations and other water wildlife. 
			Methods are being put in place to combat the negative affects brought upon these ecosystems, so hopefully in a few years it will be much safer to build and maintain hydropower plants.

       	<h1>Geothermal Power</h1>
        <img src="./Images/Geothermal Energy.jpg" alt="">
       	<p>
			Geothermal power plants are my favorite type of sustainable energy producer. 
			They rely on the earth’s core heat to heat water to around 150C. 
			This very hot gas pushes turbine blades which produces power. 
			Coal power is created in much the same way, but geothermal power plants don’t have the same side effects. 
			However, sometimes aggressive drilling can lead to seismic activity. 
			This is usually fine because they are often built far away from cities.	
       	</p>
		<p>
			One reason why they are not very common is that the most power-producing plants are most efficient if built in places where geysers and other geothermal activity are present. 
			To build this type of power plant, it also takes a large investment to produce a comparatively small amount of power. 
			This cost can consider an investment but is also a determent for people looking for short-term power solutions.
